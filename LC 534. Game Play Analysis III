# Write your MySQL query statement below

# OUTPUT: total #games played by each player UNTIL that date


My Solution:
SELECT player_id, event_date, SUM(games_played) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS games_played_so_far
FROM Activity


Code explaination:
Usually when the result has something to do with neighbors, we should think of window function.
Here we can think of using SUM. 
The trickiest part is the ORDER BY  inside this over cell. If we don't use it, then it will simply sum up all the games no matter the date. 
This ORDER BY actually tells the machine that for each record, it should calculate then sum until that date.
